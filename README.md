Data Engineering Zoomcamp Projects 2024 #datatalksclub

### Description: 

Notably, I participated in key modules and workshops: Containerization and Infrastructure as Code, Workflow Orchestration, Data Ingestion, Data Warehouse, Analytics Engineering, and Batch Processing. I gained proficiency in Docker, Terraform, workflow orchestration tools like Mage, data warehousing with BigQuery, and analytics engineering using dbt. Hands-on experience in data ingestion, normalization, and Spark batch processing further augmented my skills. Equipped with a robust skill set spanning these areas, I'm poised to contribute effectively to innovative projects in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and data analytics.
